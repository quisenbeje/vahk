vi key mapping for os using a autohotkey script. created originally for making microsoft word act like vi, but also functional for whatever other apps you are using.

it's a bit rough at the moment, but functional.
  - #v - (win+v) to toggle vi key bindings

the color of the background image will vary depending on the mode
  - black: off
  - yellow: normal
  - orange: visual
  - blue: insert
  - pink: replace

look at the script to see all key bindings. it the usual suspects, h,j,k,l,w,b,^f,^b,gg,G,o,O... see the script for all the bindings.  many more could and will be added.
